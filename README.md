# Bindr

Bindr addresses the challenge of unorganized study resources and lack of structured study
support for students. Students often struggle to manage notes, identify key concepts, and stay
on top of deadlines, leading to gaps in comprehension and missed assignments. Bindr is
designed as an AI-powered, user-friendly web application that provides students with an
interactive, personalized tool to organize study material, practice concepts, and keep track of
deadlines. It has a few different features, including a document chat, file hub, calendar, and a study plan creator.
